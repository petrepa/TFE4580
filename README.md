This repository contains the specialization project done by Peter Rem√∏y Paulsen, the fall of 2020, as a part of his masters degree in electronical engineering. 

We took a deeper look into realism in AR, and tried to figure out what the level of occlusion has to say for the Quailty of Experience for the user in an augmented reality system. 

[Complete report can be found here.](https://github.com/petrepa/TFE4580/blob/master/TFE4580_peterrp_final_report.pdf)

## Description
To test if occlusion can have anything to say, we built an augemnted reality app using Unity and ARCore.

In the app the participants exposed of either environment 1 or environment 2

| **Environment**      | **Description**           |
|----------------------|---------------------------|
| Environment 1        | Occlusion algorithm component from ARCores API **enabled**, so that the environment is able to capture depth data and occlude virtual objects in the real world |
| Environment 2        | Occlusion algorithm component **disabled**. No dapth data captured. Virtual objects will float above real objects. |


**In action:**

Environemnt 1          |  Environmnet 2
