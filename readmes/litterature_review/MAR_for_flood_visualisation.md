# Mobile AR for Flood Visualisation 

Flood risk management (FRM)
* Increased need to communicate flood risks as a precautinary measure 

Problems:
* Registering points in the real world with points on the device display and correctly displaying 3D graphics in the correct perspective

Conclusion
* MAR apps can potentially be usefull for FRM tasks
* Greater geometric model complexity was required to be useful for serious application
* Further work must be done to the underlying AR technology
    * Wide area SLAM algorithm
    * Triangulation of natural features via SLAM
* Improvement must be don to in situ modeling
